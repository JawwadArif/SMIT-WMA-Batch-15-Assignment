ðŸš€ Successfully Completed My 3rd HTML Assignment! ðŸŽ‰

I'm excited to share that I've just completed my 3rd HTML assignment as part of my learning journey! This time, I worked on creating a Time Management Plan Template using HTML tables and introduced some CSS styling to make the design more visually appealing.

Key Highlights:
ðŸ”¹ HTML Tables: I learned to organize data effectively by using HTML tables to structure a weekly schedule, with time slots and activities.
ðŸ”¹ CSS Styling: Introduced CSS to enhance the visual design, including background colors for different task categories and improving table layout with borders and padding.
ðŸ”¹ Responsive Design: Used media queries to make the layout adaptable to smaller screen sizes, ensuring a mobile-friendly user experience.

This assignment gave me the chance to further develop my skills in HTML structure and CSS styling, while also understanding how to present data in a clear and user-friendly manner.

What I Learned:
How to create and customize HTML tables for effective data presentation.
Introduction to CSS for improving design and layout.
The importance of making web pages responsive to enhance user experience on all devices.
Looking forward to continuing my learning journey and tackling more challenging projects! ðŸ’»âœ¨
